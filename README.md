This repository is an introduction to quantum computing and programming (using the library Qiskit). It should provide a basic understanding of the field to a beginner.

It covers the following topics:
- Basics of quantum information (Dirac notation, vector state representation, entanglement, measurements, unitary operations)
- Basics of quantum circuits
- Superdense coding
- Quantum Teleportation
- Quantum Fourier Transform
- Quantum Phase Estimation
- [Draper QFT Adder]([https://link-url-here.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0008033))
- Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm

Prerequisites: Linear algebra (orthonormal basis, vectors, matrices), Basic algorithmic and Python programming.
