## Introduction to Quantum Computing and Programming

This repository is an introduction to quantum computing and programming (using the library [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)). It should provide a basic understanding of the field to a beginner.

It covers the following topics:
- Basics of quantum information (braket notation, vector state representation, entanglement, measurements, unitary operations, no-cloning theorem)
- Basics of quantum circuit model
- Superdense coding
- Quantum Teleportation
- Quantum Fourier Transform
- Quantum Phase Estimation
- Draper QFT Adder
- Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm
- Grover's algorithm

To complete the picture, here's an excellent book for a more in-depth look at the Quantum Computing field:

[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Michael A. Nielsen & Isaac L. Chuang](https://profmcruz.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information-nielsen-chuang.pdf)

A good introduction for people with an undergraduate level:

[Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing, Thomas G. Wong](https://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing-1e4p.pdf)


*Prerequisites: Linear algebra (orthonormal basis, vectors, matrices), Basic algorithmic and Python programming.*
